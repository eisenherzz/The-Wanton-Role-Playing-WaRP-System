## Glossary
**Bonus Die** — An extra die rolled with the normal dice for an attempted action when the character has some advantage. Drop out the lowest die before tallying the total for the roll.

**Experience Pool** — The number of dice that a character can use as bonus dice each game. They double as a measure of experience and can be “spent” to improve traits or develop new traits.

**Fringe Powers** — Powers not readily recognized as possible by the mundane world, including abilities that could be classified as psychic or magical.

**Game Moderator (GM)** — the person who coordinates the series (i.e. “gamemaster”).

**GMC** — Game Moderator Character (i.e. NPC, or non-player-character), a character run by the game moderator.

**Hit Points** — A measure of a character’s ability to take damage and punishment. If reduced to 0 hit points, you’re down and out of the fight. A character deep in the negatives is either dead or will die without medical care.

**Round** — In combat, or other intense encounters, a unit of time in which a character can generally take one action. Represents about 3 seconds of time in the game world.

**Penalty Die** — An extra die rolled with the normal dice when the character has some disadvantage. Drop out the highest die before totalling the roll.

**PC** — Player character, a character run by one of the players.

**Psychic Pool** — Represents how often a character can use psychic or fringe powers.

**Series** — a string of related game sessions, a “campaign.”

**Trait** — A feature of a character, representing a skill, personal characteristic, fringe power, talent, or aspect of one’s background. Traits are usually good, but some (called “flaws”) are bad.

## Rules Overview
### Character Checklist
Your character includes:  

* **_Concept_**
* **_Traits & Signs_** *
* **_Hit Points_**
* **_Experience Pool_** **
* **_Motivation_**
* **_Secret_**
* **_Important Person_**
* **_Name, Background, Equipment, Finances, etc._**

\* central trait and two side traits (one of these is your superior trait); one flaw; a sign for each trait (including the flaw).  
\**  Your experience pool starts as one die.  

### Mechanics
When you use a trait, you roll a number of dice equal to its score (usually three dice, or four dice for your superior trait).

If you get a **bonus die** (by having some advantage), you roll an extra die along with your normal dice and then drop the lowest die out of the bunch. If you have to roll a **penalty die** (from having some disadvantage), roll an extra die along with your normal ones, but drop out the highest one.

You compare your roll vs. that made by the GM, usually representing a GMC’s traits. You succeed if you beat the GM’s roll or the **difficulty factor** she assigns.

####Sample Difficulty Factors

  **Task**       **Difficulty Factor**   **_or_**   **Dice to Roll**
-------------   ----------------------- ---------- ------------------
Easy                    4                                   1
Moderate                7                                   2
Hard                    11                                  3
Really Difficult        14                                  4
Near Impossible         18+                               5 or 6

### Your Experience Pool
You can use the die in your **experience pool** to improve one roll per game session. Once you use the experience die, you cannot use it again in that session. The dice from your experience pool act as a bonus dice. As you play, you can acquire more dice for your pool.

## Creating a Character
### Concept
First, get an idea of the character you will portray. Have a good idea of who you want to be before you start any details. An example concept might be, “A psycho-killer commando who escaped from CIA brain-washing program when the programming failed.”

### Traits
Each character has four **traits**. One trait is the character’s **central trait**, usually defining who that character is. Two traits are **side traits**, additional skills or characteristics. Of the above three traits, one is chosen as **superior**. The last trait is a **flaw** or disadvantage. Each of the four traits entails a **sign**, some visible or tangible aspect of that trait.

#### Central Trait
First, you have one **central trait**, essentially your identity — who you are, what you do. This trait can take into account a variety of aptitudes, skills, or characteristics. When you, as a player, describe your character, you are likely to use this trait as the central concept. For example, “I’m a model,” or “I’m a former secret agent.” If you want to be something weird, this trait must cover that identity.
A central trait includes the name of the trait followed by a description, then in parentheses sign(s) that are associated with the trait. Numbers at the end of the description indicate the number of dice that would be assigned to that trait normally (the first, lower number) and how many dice would be assigned if it is the character’s **superior trait** (the second, larger number; see later for an explanation of superior traits). If the scores listed are “4/6,” this represents higher than normal scores for “**narrow**” traits. See that optional rule later in this section.

An example central trait might be:  
**Military Background** — Includes fighting bare-handed and with a variety of weapons, first aid, keeping cool under fire, and possibly one specialty field, such as mechanics or demolitions. (Wears camo clothes, or battle scars) 3/4

If you want to have an unusual character, perhaps the kind of thing that does not exist in the real world (like an alien), you must take that trait as your central trait. Give the trait a name and description, being sure to be clear to the GM what skills, abilities, and characteristics this trait covers. If you have a weird, unusual power, the GM may give you a “psychic pool,” which represents how many times per day you can use that power. This pool may contain 3 shots (uses per day), or you can roll a die to see how many shots it contains. (If you have several fringe powers, you can roll the die once for each and take the highest roll.) GM rules for fringe abilities are found later in this document.

#### Unknown Attributes
An interesting way to speed up character creation and bring some mystery to the process is to identify certain attributes as unknown to you and to the character. For example, you might be an escapee from an experimental mental illness treatment that has given you powers that you don’t even know much about yet. In that case, tell your GM that you want one or more of your traits undefined at the start. Or your motivation might be to follow certain clues, the significance of which you do not yet fully understand. Your GM might well appreciate the freedom that this tactic gives her in manipulating your character into the plots that she will lay for you and your fellow players.

#### Side Traits
Once you have your central, identifying trait chosen, chose two **side traits**. They may or may not be related to your central trait. Unlike the central traits, these side traits are very specific, representing discrete characteristics or skills.

Just because a trait is your “side trait” does not mean it is insignificant to your character. For example, a professor with the side trait of “hack writing” might be pursuing her writing career, and her attempts to gain inspiration for her fiction may be more important in play than her teaching career. Indeed, she may be better at writing than teaching.

A side trait includes the name of the trait followed by a description, then in parentheses sign(s) that are associated with the trait. Numbers at the end of the description indicate the number of dice the character receives for a normal and **superior** version of that trait, respectively. If the scores listed are “4/6,” this represents higher than normal scores for “**narrow**” traits. See that optional rule later in this section.

An example side trait might be:  
**Tough** — Resist poisons, pain, and fatigue. (Big-boned) 3/4

Any unusual type of power, usually called “magical” or “psychic,” is a fringe power. Most likely you have a “psychic pool,” representing the number of times per day you can use this power. You can have 3 shots in your pool, or roll a die to determine the number of shots. If you have several fringe powers, you can roll the die once for each and take the highest roll. Give yourself a side trait with the name and description of the power. The sign for a fringe power depends on the nature of the power, and its dice scores are usually 1/2. GM rules for fringe abilities are found later in this document.

#### More About Traits
The GM looks over your traits and may veto or edit any that she judges to be out of order. She’ll probably allow traits like “Exceptionally tough,” but might disallow “Completely impervious to all manner of attack, damage, threat to life, or heartache.”

Take care in naming your trait. Make each unique. If your character is to have a way with words, is she “well-spoken,” “manipulative,” or “silver-tongued”? While the distinctions among terms may be slight, they affect your perception of the character and can affect the character’s abilities in special circumstances.
