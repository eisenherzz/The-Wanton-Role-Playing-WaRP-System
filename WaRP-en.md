## Glossary
**Bonus Die** — An extra die rolled with the normal dice for an attempted action when the character has some advantage. Drop out the lowest die before tallying the total for the roll.

**Experience Pool** — The number of dice that a character can use as bonus dice each game. They double as a measure of experience and can be “spent” to improve traits or develop new traits.

**Fringe Powers** — Powers not readily recognized as possible by the mundane world, including abilities that could be classified as psychic or magical.

**Game Moderator (GM)** — the person who coordinates the series (i.e. “gamemaster”).

**GMC** — Game Moderator Character (i.e. NPC, or non-player-character), a character run by the game moderator.

**Hit Points** — A measure of a character’s ability to take damage and punishment. If reduced to 0 hit points, you’re down and out of the fight. A character deep in the negatives is either dead or will die without medical care.

**Round** — In combat, or other intense encounters, a unit of time in which a character can generally take one action. Represents about 3 seconds of time in the game world.

**Penalty Die** — An extra die rolled with the normal dice when the character has some disadvantage. Drop out the highest die before totalling the roll.

**PC** — Player character, a character run by one of the players.

**Psychic Pool** — Represents how often a character can use psychic or fringe powers.

**Series** — a string of related game sessions, a “campaign.”

**Trait** — A feature of a character, representing a skill, personal characteristic, fringe power, talent, or aspect of one’s background. Traits are usually good, but some (called “flaws”) are bad.

## Rules Overview
### Character Checklist
Your character includes:  

* **_Concept_**
* **_Traits & Signs_** *
* **_Hit Points_**
* **_Experience Pool_** **
* **_Motivation_**
* **_Secret_**
* **_Important Person_**
* **_Name, Background, Equipment, Finances, etc._**

\* central trait and two side traits (one of these is your superior trait); one flaw; a sign for each trait (including the flaw).  
\**  Your experience pool starts as one die.  

### Mechanics
When you use a trait, you roll a number of dice equal to its score (usually three dice, or four dice for your superior trait).

If you get a **bonus die** (by having some advantage), you roll an extra die along with your normal dice and then drop the lowest die out of the bunch. If you have to roll a **penalty die** (from having some disadvantage), roll an extra die along with your normal ones, but drop out the highest one.

You compare your roll vs. that made by the GM, usually representing a GMC’s traits. You succeed if you beat the GM’s roll or the **difficulty factor** she assigns.

####Sample Difficulty Factors

  **Task**       **Difficulty Factor**   **_or_**   **Dice to Roll**
-------------   ----------------------- ---------- ------------------
Easy                    4                                   1
Moderate                7                                   2
Hard                    11                                  3
Really Difficult        14                                  4
Near Impossible         18+                               5 or 6

### Your Experience Pool
You can use the die in your **experience pool** to improve one roll per game session. Once you use the experience die, you cannot use it again in that session. The dice from your experience pool act as a bonus dice. As you play, you can acquire more dice for your pool.
